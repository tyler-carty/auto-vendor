# auto-vendor-web-app

A reliable, scalable web application for the management of a fictional vehicle rental company.

Uses technologies such as:  
  HTML,  
  CSS,  
  PHP,  
  MySQL,   
  JavaScript.  

This project needs both the folder with the website markup (www) as well as the database file (auto) to function as intended.

Using a MySQL compatible web-server, put the website content folder in your WWW folder, and the "auto" folder in your
corresponding SQL tables folder. Either create yourself a login directly in the database, or use the following login to
access all sections of the website:

Username- Tyler  
Password- Tyler  

Otherwise, you can refer to the Presentation MP4 file where I go through the entire website and its functionality.
